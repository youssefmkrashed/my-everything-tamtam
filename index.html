    My sweet Fatma,<br><br>
    Just like a hippo finds joy in a puddle, I find endless happiness in your presence. Your smile lights up my days, your laugh is the melody of my heart, and your love is the letter I want to read forever.<br><br>
    With every heartbeat, I send you my love, sealed with a kiss and carried by this chubby little hippo. ❤️🐾💌🍅<br><br>
    Yours forever,<br>
    Youssef M. Krashed 💘
